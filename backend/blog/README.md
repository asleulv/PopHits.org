# PopHits.org Blog Module

This module adds a blog feature to PopHits.org with support for related songs.

## Features

- Blog posts with rich text content
- Featured images for posts
- SEO optimization with meta descriptions
- Related songs section that links to songs in the database
- Admin interface for managing blog posts

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration

Run the following commands to create the necessary database tables:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations blog
python manage.py migrate blog
```

### 2. Emoji Support (MySQL Only)

We've implemented full emoji support for blog posts:

1. Updated Django settings to use utf8mb4 charset
2. Created a migration (0002_alter_charset_to_utf8mb4.py) that automatically converts the blog tables to utf8mb4

This ensures that you can use emoji characters (like ðŸŽµ, ðŸŽ¤, ðŸŽ¸) in your blog posts without any additional configuration.

If you encounter any character encoding issues, make sure you've run all migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate blog
```

### 3. Creating Blog Posts

1. Go to the Django admin panel: http://localhost:8000/admin/
2. Navigate to the Blog section
3. Click "Add Blog Post"

   - Title: The blog post title
   - Slug: URL-friendly version of the title (auto-generated if left blank)
